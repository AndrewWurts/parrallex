    <h2>Who is andrew and why does he like dogs so much</h2>
    <p>
Andrew was born in massachusetts in 2000. He might be going to college next year and one thing for sure is he is a big fan of dogs. Small dogs, big dogs, lap dogs, and guard dogs. The ecstatic feeling of joy which comes from petting dogs fills his brain up with dopamine and relives his stress.
    His love for dogs probably originates from the dog in the image, olivers dog: "lexi", who is very soft and cuddly.</p>
